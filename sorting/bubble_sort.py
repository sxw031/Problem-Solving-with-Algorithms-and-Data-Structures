### bubble sort - most inefficient sorting method, but an advantange in that it will recognize the sorted list and stop.
# As with a bubble sort, after the first pass, the largest item is in the correct place. After the second pass, the next largest is in place. 
# It compares adjacent items and exchanges those that are out of order. 
# If there are n items in the list, then there are nâˆ’1 pairs of items that need to be compared on the first pass.
# The total comparison is n-1 + n-2 + ...1  =====> O(): (1/2n^2 - 1/2n) ====> O(n^2)
# swap i and j: 
#    temp = alist[i]
#    alist[i] = alist[j]
#    alist[j] = temp
# python can do swap in simultaneous assignment a,b = b,a
