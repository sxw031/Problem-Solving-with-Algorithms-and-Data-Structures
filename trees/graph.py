### What is Graph?
# Tree is a special kind of graph
# Good examples are paths

### Vocabulary and Definitions
# Vertex or node - It can have a name we called key. The additional informtion of it is "payload"
# Edge or arc - one way or two way to show a relationship between two vertices. 
#               directed graph or digraph: If the edges in a graph are all one-way.
# Weight - the cost to show that there is a cost to go from one vertex to another.
# Path - sequence of vertices that are connected by edges (V3, V4, V0, V1) for example
# Cycle - A cycle in a directed graph that starts and ends at the same vertex. graph without cycle is called acyclic graph.
#         DAG - Direct Acyclic Graph. A direct graph with no cycles.

# A graph can be represented as G = (E,V), where V is a set of vertices and E is a set of edges.
# Each Edge is a tuple(v,w,5), for example from v to w, the weight is 5.

### ADT(Abstract Data Type)
# Graph() creates a new, empty graph.
# addVertex(vert) adds an instance of Vertex to the graph.
# addEdge(fromVert, toVert) Adds a new, directed edge to the graph that connects two vertices.
# addEdge(fromVert, toVert, weight) Adds a new, weighted, directed edge to the graph that connects two vertices.
# getVertex(vertKey) finds the vertex in the graph named vertKey.
# getVertices() returns the list of all vertices in the graph. 
# in returns True for a statement of the form vertex in graph, if the given vertex is in the graph, False otherwise.

### Implementations
# There are two well-known implementations of a graph, the adjecency matrix and the adjecency list.

## 1. An adjecency Matrix
# each of the rows and columns represent a vertex in the graph.
# the value stored in the cell indicates if there is an edge from vertex x to vertex w, the value also can represent the weight.
# When two vertices are connected by an edge, we say that they are adjacent.
# Advantage: simple and easy to see with small graphs. good for when the number of edges is large, in other word, not sparsely connected which is not usually the case.
# Disadvantage: most of the cells are empty.

## 2. An adjecency List (we implement it)
# more efficient way
# a master list of all the vertices in the Graph object
# In each vertex object in the graph, maintains a list of the other vertices that it is conencted to . This we can use Dictionary.

# holds the master list of vertices, which maps vertex names to vertex objects
