# Problem-Solving-with-Algorithms-and-Data-Structures
This is a collection of study materials and practices from the online Python Book and my 2nd step of learning to program as well.

The content of this collection is self-taught and followed through the very famous book online for those who wants to learn programming using Python. The book is provided [here](http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/pythonds/index.html).

I have researched many on how to learn programming and finalized 

- Step 1. the Udacity intro to CS course which I have included the practice and materials in the other repository: [here](https://github.com/sxw031/Udacity-Intro-to-CS-HW)
- Step 2. The foundation of programming which is this course, where I learned the analysis of run/space time, searching/sorting, linked list(unordered list), ordered list, stack/queue, hashing table, graph/tree and etc.
- Step 3. To be continued [here](http://wang-shijie.ghost.io) at my page.
